# Frontend Mentor: Profile Card Component

Solution to the _[Profile Card Component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/profile-card-component-cfArpWshJ)_ challenge on Frontend Mentor.

### Challenge

- Build out a profile card component using provided [desktop](/assets/design/desktop-design.jpg) and [mobile](/assets/design/mobile-design.jpg) designs

### Solution

Live Site: [https://tinuola.github.io/fm_profile-card/](https://tinuola.github.io/fm_profile-card/)

### Retrospective

- Seemingly simple project with slightly unusual layout elements to resolve:
  - The "orbs" or semi-circular graphics in the background
  - The user image in the center of the card component
- Using pseudo-elements turned out to be the key, though with the orbs there was an [approach](https://github.com/0xabdulkhalid/profile-card-component/) that did not involve using these keywords
  - Yet another reminder of how often these keywords come into play to solve tricky or unusual styling issues

### Enhancement(s)

- Possible animation effect for practice

### Tools & Resources

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- CSS Resets
- Background image:
